<h1>Harjit's All Time Favourite Movies</h1>
<h2>My top 5 movies of all time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>The Prestige</h3>
<p>The acting performances of Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman are wonderful, as well as the jumbled story telling, very curious.</p>
<h3>Inglorious Basterds</h3>
<p>Loved the style of film making, the alternate take on history, and amazing acting performances</p>
<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>Again, one of the greatest performances ever by Heath Ledger, and the storytelling is amazing.</p>
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>A visually stunning movie with a thought-provoking story and an incredible score by Hans Zimmer.</p>
<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>A mind-bending thriller with a complex narrative and outstanding performances by the cast.</p>
