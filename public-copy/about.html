<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am a IT professional with a diverse background and skill set. I'm experienced in all things QA, having worked in Banking, Insurance, Telecom, and Entertainment domains. 
  I've led, trained and managed QA teams locally and offshore, organizing testing efforts, creating test plans, identifying opportunities and implementing automation, and executing test cases.
  Over the years I've also learned web development, and have created a few projects that I'm proud of. I'm excited to continue to learn and grow in the web development space.
  I'm proficient in Javascript, HTML, CSS, React, Node.js, and Python. I'm passionate about quality, development and learning about new technologies.
